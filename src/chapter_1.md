# Slide One: Problem Statement

## The environment is designed for miscommunication.

   * We think we're thinkers, but we're feelers.  We act on emotion.  We pay attention to that which is outrageous, and the costs of those payments are mounting into insurmountable emotional debt.

   * We are outraged because it's attention grabbing, maybe more attention grabbing than anything else.

# Slide Two: Problem Scale

## Vast

   * this isn't a cryptocurrency scoped issue
   * this is a problem that's on the scale of environmental concerns, war, pandemics.   It is, in a real sense "existential" for our species. 

  That's as big a problem as there is... but there's an exciting corollary..  the bigger the problem..  the more significant the solution!

# Slide ???

This is diversification of utility for Zcash.   Cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and are somewhat decoupled from messaging markets.

It also means we're going to charge a fee that goes, not to Zingo Labs...  but to Chaqui R&D and enhancement.
Now

In other words, we aim to **catalyze** the diversification of Zcash **beyond** mere cryptocurrency...    not to build it all by ourselves, but to expose the fantastic technologies that others have already built..   to the world!
