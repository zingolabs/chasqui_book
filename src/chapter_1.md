  Problem Statement: The environment is designed for miscommunication.

   * We think we're thinkers, but we're feelers.  We act on emotion.  We pay attention to that which is outrageous, and the costs of those payments are mounting into insurmountable emotional debt.

   * We are outraged because it's attention grabbing, maybe more attention grabbing than anything else.

  Problem Scale:

   * this isn't a cryptocurrency scoped issue
   * this is a problem that's on the scale of environmental concerns, war, pandemics.   It is, in a real sense "existential" for our species. 

  That's as big a problem as there is... but there's an exciting corollary..  the bigger the problem..  the more significant the solution!


This is diversification of utility for Zcash.   Cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and are somewhat decoupled from messaging markets.

It also means we're going to charge a fee that goes, not to Zingo Labs...  but to Chaqui R&D and enhancement.
Now

In other words, we aim to **catalyze** the diversification of Zcash **beyond** mere cryptocurrency...    not to build it all by ourselves, but to expose the fantastic technologies that others have already built..   to the world!
